My name is Labhya Mehta, and I am studying Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. I am passionate about spaceflight mechanics, aeromodelling, and space systems. On campus, I am involved with CU AIR, where I build unmanned aerial vehicles, and WOAA. I am particularly drawn to the intersection of engineering design and computational simulation, leveraging tools like CAD, MySQL, and Python to model, analyze, and visualize complex systems. Through my projects and research interests in space systems engineering, I aim to contribute to advancing safe, efficient, and sustainable flight technologies.
