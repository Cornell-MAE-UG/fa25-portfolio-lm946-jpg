Task:
Given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length (your choice) , 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator (pick from this online catalog, use max force values only), design a frame/ mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height. Assume all the supports and a bar/actuator are rigid. 

Length of the bar: 140 cm
Selected Actuaor: IMA55
Peak Force Thrust: 35.61 kN
Maximum Tilt Angle: Theta max
Coefficient of Friction
Actuator Pin Distance from pivot: 0.80 m
Actuator Stroke Length: 152.4 mm to 457.2 mm

For this design, I used a 1.4 m rigid bar supported by two ground pins and actuated by an IMA 55 linear actuator capable of delivering a peak thrust of 35.81 kN with a stroke range of 152.4 mm to 457.2 mm. Assuming the actuator acts perpendicular to the bar (beta = 90 degrees) and is pinned 0.8 m from the pivot, the torque balance equation W_max = (F_max * d * sin(beta)) / (L * sin(theta_max)) was used to determine the maximum liftable weight, while the lifted height was expressed as h = L * sin(theta_max). A Python optimizer in VS Code iterated over feasible tilt angles within the 50 cm workspace to maximize both weight and height simultaneously through a performance score proportional to W_max * h. The analysis revealed an optimal configuration that balances mechanical advantage and vertical reach, allowing the mechanism to lift the heaviest possible load to the highest feasible height within the given geometric and actuator constraints.
